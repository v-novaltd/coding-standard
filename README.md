# Coding Standard

This repository contains the V-Nova International Limited Coding Standard, maintained by V-Nova Limited which is responsible for V-Nova Projects.   
All engineers are expected to follow this standard, which is divided into two main sections: a set of best practices and a style guide.

The [best practices](docs/best_practices.md) sets out a set of guidelines to try and prevent bugs, avoid common mistakes
and improve code's readability and maintainability.

The [style guide](docs/style.md) sets out a set of rules to have all V-Nova code have the same look and feel.

Additionally, there is also a [glossary](docs/glossary.md) that serves as a reference for some of the more esoteric C++ terms
that may not be familiar to everyone.
